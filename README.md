# Billionaires

This repository contains a website showing how the wealth of America's top billionaires compare to the population of the United States after hefty purchases. The intention of this project is to show the absurdity of the wealth of America's top billionaires and to show the necessity of a more fair wealth and income distribution in America.

This project is made using the plotly dash framework for web development with python. To run the website as is after cloning the repository run app.py (recommendded python 3.7) and follow to the local host link to the website hosted on your machine. This will create some supplementary text files to keep track of when the website was last updatesd. Web hosting and link TBD.

This project also uses the forbes400 api to retrieve data and their image api that do not require an api key. Measures are put in place so as not to call the api repeatedly unless needed. To ensure these measures are sustained to not delete the text files generated when running the website.
