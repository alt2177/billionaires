Suggestions:
- Write in the website name and a short description of what the site does
- Indicate that the first dropdown menu is for selecting a billionaire
- Have the description of the billionaire next to their image rather than 
below. Also, indicate the cost of items selected and the remaining amount 
of money in this div. Increase text size.
- The 10 million dollar mansion is a bit redundant. Find an example of a really
expensive piece of real estate to use instead
- (Not sure if this is possible) but I would try to include commas to make the 
big numbers easier to read
- Maybe include how much money the billionaire makes per minute, then for a 
selected item, you can calculate how long it would take to save up for this 
item (e.g. If Jeff Bezos wanted to save up to buy a Boeing 737, it would take
X hours)
- Maybe include some div that displays the number of things the user has 
selected to buy and the total (essntially a reciept that updates as the user
continues to add/subtract items)
